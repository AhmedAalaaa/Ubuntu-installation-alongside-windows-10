### Burning the ISO
You will need a tool to burn the ISO on your flash drive, I used [Rufus software tool](https://rufus.ie/en/) to burn it.
### Seperate 100GB for the OS
Before going to the installation steps, you need to free up 100GB on your drive, right click on _This PC_ and then press device manager -> storage -> Disk Management, and shrink 100GB form any drive you want.
